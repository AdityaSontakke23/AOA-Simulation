# All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation of the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**, used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.

## * How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the index.html in vs code (no server required).
3. Use the input section to enter the number of nodes and their distance matrix.
4. Click **Start Simulation** to begin.
5. Use **Next Step** to proceed through each step of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
6. Use **Reset** to start again with a new input.

## * Example Input

Suppose you have 4 nodes and want to simulate the following distance matrix:

|     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 0 | 3 | ∞ | 7 |
| 2   | 8 | 0 | 2 | ∞ |
| 3   | 5 | ∞ | 0 | 1 |
| 4   | 2 | ∞ | ∞ | 0 |

- Represent ∞ (infinity) as INF or leave the input field blank (depending on implementation).
- After completing the simulation, the output matrix should show the shortest distances between all pairs.

## * Expected Output

The final matrix (after running all steps) should look like:

|     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 0 | 3 | 5 | 6 |
| 2   | 5 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 3   | 3 | 6 | 0 | 1 |
| 4   | 2 | 5 | 7 | 0 |

## * Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- JavaScript

---

## * Notes

- Input values must be non-negative integers or left blank for infinite distance.
- Minimum of 2 nodes and maximum of 10 nodes allowed.
