## ðŸ”¹ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the `index.html` in vs code (no server required).
3. Use the input section to enter the number of nodes and their distance matrix.
4. Click **Start Simulation** to begin.
5. Use **Next Step** to proceed through each step of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
6. Use **Reset** to start again with a new input.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Input

Suppose you have 4 nodes and want to simulate the following distance matrix:

|     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 0 | 3 | âˆž | 7 |
| 2   | 8 | 0 | 2 | âˆž |
| 3   | 5 | âˆž | 0 | 1 |
| 4   | 2 | âˆž | âˆž | 0 |

- Represent âˆž (infinity) as `INF` or leave the input field blank (depending on implementation).
- After completing the simulation, the output matrix should show the shortest distances between all pairs.

## ðŸ”¹ Expected Output

The final matrix (after running all steps) should look like:

|     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 0 | 3 | 5 | 6 |
| 2   | 5 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 3   | 3 | 6 | 0 | 1 |
| 4   | 2 | 5 | 7 | 0 |

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- Vanilla JavaScript

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Input values must be non-negative integers or left blank for infinite distance.
- Minimum of 2 nodes and maximum of 10 nodes allowed.
